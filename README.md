#### Is our problem valid?
  * What do people care about?
  * How much do people want to know about other attendees' location?
  * How difficult is it for people to create and invite people to events?
#### Is our solution valid?
  * How do we get people to use without installing a new app?
  * And how do we get people to install a new app?

### MVP
##### Step 1:
* Easy event creation & invite process
* Event host creates a URL or code and sends that to anyone he wishes
* Users accept by going to that URL
* Once user hits URL, user can decide how to receive notifications on the event
##### Step 2:
* Location based tracking
* Full features for app, limited features for web, no tracking otherwise (email or text)
* Smart notifications of when you should leave based on your distance to event & other attendees distance to event.
* How far are other people?
* Needs a sexy design for the UI of distance tracking.
  * List (standings)
  * Line (vertical)
  * Circle

### Additional Features
* Event creation flexibility
  * Ability to create an event without specific location or time. You can use people's location to smartly suggest event details.
* History data of event preferences and invites
  * Suggest based on history
* Optional: Gamification of tardiness results. Punish those who are late, reward those on time.
